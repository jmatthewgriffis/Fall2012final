This is my combined final project for my CCLab and Major Studio 1 classes to wrap up the
Fall 2012 semester of the MFA in Design and Technology at Parsons the New School for Design.

I want to do something in 3D using openFrameworks for the CCLab side of things, and something
with a heavier emphasis on the aesthetic (than in my previous work) for Major Studio. Voila.
